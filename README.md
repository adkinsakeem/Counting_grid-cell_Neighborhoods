# Counting_grid-cell_Neighborhoods

This is my completed **Counting_grid-cell_Neighborhoods** assessment.

## Important Files
The main file that contains the working code is **GridCell_Neighborhood_Routine.java.** This is the file that should be submitted for review. That file is located here [*Counting_grid-cell_neighborhoods/src/gridCell_neighborhoods/GridCell_Neighborhood_Routine.java*](Counting_grid-cell_neighborhoods/src/gridCell_neighborhoods/GridCell_Neighborhood_Routine.java).

The **Main_Gridcell_Class.java** file is the file that allows the code to be tested with a pre-set two-dimensional array for the grid. That file is located here [*Counting_grid-cell_neighborhoods/src/gridCell_neighborhoods/Main_Gridcell_Class.java*](Counting_grid-cell_neighborhoods/src/gridCell_neighborhoods/Main_Gridcell_Class.java).

The **EnteredValueException.java** file is not as important as the other files. It contains the custom Exception used in both the *GridCell_Neighborhood_Routine.java* and the *Main_Gridcell_Class.java* files. That file is located here [*Counting_grid-cell_neighborhoods/src/gridCell_neighborhoods/EnteredValueException.java*](Counting_grid-cell_neighborhoods/src/gridCell_neighborhoods/EnteredValueException.java)
